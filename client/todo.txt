Smart Contract changes

Kittycontract:
-	 Approve needs to unapproved also
Kittymarketplace:
-	getAllTokenOnSale can change name and should not return inactive offers

Questions:
How do we deal with transaction wait time in live applications?  We instruct the user to a waiting screen and notify them when the event is heard somehow?
